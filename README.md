# 🛒 Amazon Sales Data Analysis  

**Project Date:** October 2025  
**Tools Used:** MySQL · Power BI · Exploratory Analysis · Data Cleaning · Data Visualization · Business Insights  .

## 📘 Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing **Amazon Sales data** to understand which **payment methods** generated the most **revenue** and which experienced the highest **cancellation rates**.  
The main goal was to identify customer payment preferences and evaluate their impact on total revenue across different cities.  

## ⚙️ Methodology  

The project followed a complete analytics workflow from data exploration to insight generation:  

1. **Data Understanding** – Reviewed the dataset and identified key variables such as order_id, category, city, payment_method, status, quantity, and total_sales.  
2. **Data Cleaning (MySQL)** – Checked for missing values and duplicates in order_id but found no major inconsistencies due to a small and clean dataset.  
3. **Data Transformation** – Created **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** to group information, calculate **percentages**, **rankings**, and summarize revenue and cancellations by payment method.  
4. **Exploratory Analysis** – Queried payment distribution, total orders, and average sales performance by category and city.  
5. **Visualization (Power BI)** – Built interactive visuals to present insights using bar charts, line charts, donuts, tables, and KPI cards.

## 💡 Key Insights  

- 💳 **Credit Card** and **PayPal** were the most used payment methods, generating the majority of total orders.  
- 🪙 **Amazon Pay** showed **high efficiency** with fewer cancellations, making it a potentially reliable method.  
- 🎁 **Gift Cards** had one of the **highest cancellation rates**, suggesting potential customer dissatisfaction or error patterns.  
- 🏙️ Among cities, the top-performing ones (e.g., Los Angeles and Dallas) had higher order averages and consistent revenue patterns.  
- 📉 Overall, cancellation-related revenue loss was moderate but concentrated in a few categories, signaling optimization opportunities.
